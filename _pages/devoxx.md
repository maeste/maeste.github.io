## Devoxx talk: Breaking Down AI Silos: Building Interoperable Multi-Agent Systems with Google's A2A Protocol and Java SDK

Google’s Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, now under the Linux Foundation, solves AI agent interoperability by providing a universal communication standard. This talk covers A2A’s architecture, secure exchanges, and a new Java SDK, with live demos showing seamless collaboration between Python, JavaScript, and Java agents in enterprise workflows.
